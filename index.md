# Welcome!

Welcome to the Sisk Framework! This project was initially created to explore the capabilities of the native .NET HttpListener and has gradually evolved into a more commercially oriented framework as I began applying it to personal and commercial projects.

### What is Sisk?

Sisk is a lightweight, agnostic, simple, and robust web development framework. Its core idea is to create a service that runs on the internet, following the patterns you define. Moreover, Sisk adapts to your preferred working style, rather than the other way around.

Due to its explicit nature, Sisk's behavior is predictable. The main differentiator from ASP.NET is that Sisk can be up and running with very few lines of code, avoiding unnecessary configurations and requiring minimal setup to get your server operational. Additionally, it does not require any additional .NET SDK packages for development, as the base package of .NET 6 is sufficient to start working with Sisk.

Sisk's philosophy emphasizes simplicity and provides all the essential tools for building cloud applications without relying on specific or proprietary technologies from other companies. However, the Sisk environment allows for the implementation of both proprietary and non-proprietary technologies, enabling their use, development, and support within the framework. Furthermore, the term "framework" refers to the collection of methods, tools, and libraries that make Sisk a complete web development ecosystem. Contributions must adhere to this philosophy and maintain readable, maintainable code that anyone with a basic understanding can read, maintain, and compile.

Sisk has a strict policy of transparency in its code. All technologies used to build Sisk **must** be open source, traceable, maintainable, and compilable, allowing anyone to edit, view, and create their own version of Sisk.

### What is Sisk for?

With Sisk, you can create RESTful applications, Web sockets, file servers, GraphQL APIs, Entity Framework integrations, and moreâ€”essentially, whatever you need. Sisk is an extremely modular and sustainable framework. Its current development is intense, with much more to be added, but the focus remains on keeping it simple, easy to maintain, and enjoyable for developers working on projects of any size.

Sisk has also been tested in low-performance environments, such as machines with less than 1GB of RAM, handling over 20,000 requests per second. The code, from the moment it arrives on the server to the response sent back, is extremely concise, with very few steps before reaching the client.

One of the pillars of developing with Sisk is its compatibility with any machine that supports .NET, including those that do not require Native AOT. Additional implementations are also provided within the Sisk ecosystem, such as porting projects to other machines using configuration files and a view engine based on LISP, among others, served with packages beyond the core Sisk package. By design, Sisk is built to work with routers, but you are not obligated to use them. Sisk provides all the necessary infrastructure to create a secure application without obfuscating your code.

There's no need for excessive ceremony, fluff, or spending hours on tedious documentation. Sisk is simple and elegant in its syntax, facilitating the development of fast and complex systems.

### But why not just use ASP.NET?

ASP.NET is a great and well-established web framework, and many features present in Sisk were inspired by it. However, Sisk focuses on simpler and more performant development, eliminating the need to install additional components in your system, project, or editor. Sisk was designed to be straightforward and robust, enabling you to create anything you desire.

Moreover, its development model allows you to choose how you want to work. You can handle requests in a simple, efficient, explicit, and fast manner. A basic understanding of HTTP is required if you want to manage everything manually, but even then, Sisk can greatly simplify the process with the functions it provides in its core package.

Getting started with Sisk is easy. Those with prior web development experience typically learn Sisk in one or two days. The Sisk documentation is a valuable resource, serving not just as a specification but as a complete manual with examples and support.
