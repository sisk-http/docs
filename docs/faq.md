# Frequently Asked Questions

Frequently asked questions about Sisk.

## Is Sisk open-source?

Totally. All source code used by Sisk is published and frequently updated on [GitHub](https://github.com/sisk-http).

## Are contributions accepted?

As long as they are compatible with the [Sisk philosophy](/), all contributions are very welcome! Contributions don't have to be just code! You can contribute with documentation, tests, translations, donations, and posts, for example.

## Is Sisk funded?

No. No organization or project currently sponsors Sisk.

## Can I use Sisk in production?

Absolutely. The project has been in development for more than three years and has had intense testing in commercial applications that have been in production since then. Sisk is used in important commercial projects as main infrastructure.

A guide on how to [deploy](/docs/deploying) in different systems and environments has been written and is available.

## Does Sisk have authentication, monitoring, and database services?

No. Sisk does not have any of these. It's a framework for developing HTTP web applications, but it's still a minimal framework that delivers what's needed for your application to work.

You can implement all the services you want using any third-party library you prefer. Sisk was made to be agnostic, flexible, and work with anything.

## Why should I use Sisk instead of <framework>?

I don't know. You tell me.

Sisk was created to fill a generic scenario for HTTP web applications in .NET. Established projects, such as ASP.NET, solve various problems, but with different biases. Unlike larger frameworks, Sisk requires the user to know what they're doing and building. Basic notions of web development and the HTTP protocol are essential for working with Sisk.

Sisk is closer to the Express of Node.js than ASP.NET Core. It's a high-level abstraction that allows you to create applications with HTTP logic that you want.

## What do I need to learn Sisk?

You need the basics of:

- Web development (HTTP, Restful, etc.)
- .NET

That's it. Having a notion of what these two topics are, you can dedicate a few hours to developing an advanced application with Sisk.

## Can I develop commercial applications with Sisk?

Absolutely.

Sisk was created under the MIT license, which means you can use Sisk in any commercial project, commercially or non-commercially, without the need for a proprietary license.

What we ask is that somewhere in your application, you have a notice of the open-source projects used in your project, and that Sisk is there.
